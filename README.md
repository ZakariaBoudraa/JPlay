# JPlay
JPlay is a launcher interface that hosts and gives access to two interactive video games: Battlefield and Blobgame. The former features a strategic tower-defense game, where players must defend a tower from the approaching monsters by placing different warriors along a path. The second game is a territory-expansion puzzle, where the goal is to manipulate blocks to take over the board ans score points.
